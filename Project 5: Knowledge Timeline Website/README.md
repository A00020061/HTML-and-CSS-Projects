# Project 5: Knowledge-Timeline-Website

[Click here](https://nostalgic-babbage-5891ac.netlify.app/) for the live demo  of the website on [Netlify](https://www.netlify.com/).

> This is a Knowledge Timeline website that acts as a resume to show the knowledge gain and the responsibility held at different stages to date.

- This website gives insight into the timeline of a person w.r.t their education, profession, and experience. This is like a web page resume.

- Creating the HTML for this is easy. But, the CSS and JS involved are challenging.

- The `animation` created to bring each module to the center of the page is done by adding classes dynamically using CSS w.r.t the position in the viewport.

- Transition, transform properties are used to complete the animation.

- Icons are used from `Font Awesome`.

- Making this webpage responsive is tricky as the layout is symmetric w.r.t the center line and animations associated with it.

- The website is made `responsive` to all the devices (desktops, tablets, and mobile phones).

- CSS is precompiled using `SCSS` for the structured coding.

- The website is hosted both on [Netlify](https://www.netlify.com/) and [GitHub Pages](https://pages.github.com/).

- The project is a part of the learning from [Brad Traversy](https://github.com/bradtraversy)'s course on Udemy. The idea credit is his. I have understood the concepts and learned them by building this on my own with a bare minimum reference of source code (only when my efforts couldn't clear the roadblock). The way of execution is modified as per my viewpoint whenever is necessary.
