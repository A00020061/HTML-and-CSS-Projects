# Project 8: Portfolio-Website

[Click here](https://compassionate-lamport-45e6ed.netlify.app/) for the live demo  of the website on [Netlify](https://www.netlify.com/).

> This portfolio website helps a freelancer to showcase their specialization, skills, process they follow to execute a project, clients on-board, testimonials, and a contact form to help the clients to reach them out.

- The `typewriter effect` is incorporated using JavaScript.

- An `image overlay` is created for the hero image using `::before and ::after pseudo-selectors`.

- `CSS animation` is used to exhibit the projects.

- Icons are used from `Font Awesome`.

- `Flexbox` is used for creating inner layouts.

- `CSS grid` is used for creating outer layouts.

- A contact form is created with a spam filter that is created using `Netlify Form` for data collection.

- The website is made `responsive` to all the devices (desktops, tablets, and mobile phones).

- CSS is precompiled using SCSS for the structured coding.

- The website is hosted on [Netlify](https://www.netlify.com/).

- The project is a part of the learning from [Brad Traversy](https://github.com/bradtraversy)'s course on Udemy. The idea credit is his. I have understood the concepts and learned them by building this on my own with a bare minimum reference of source code (only when my efforts couldn't clear the roadblock). The way of execution is modified as per my viewpoint whenever is necessary.
