# Project 6: Quick-Dropdown-Menu-Website

[Click here](https://wonderful-lichterman-0fc76f.netlify.app/) for the live demo  of the website on [Netlify](https://www.netlify.com/).

> This is a boiler-plate webpage for a Dropdown Menu that is created only CSS (no JS). This can be extended as a full-fledged website by adding the corresponding sections inside the dropdown menus.

- The `Dropdown Menus` are created only with CSS, no JavaScript at all.

- Icons are used from `Font Awesome`.

- `Flexbox` is used for creating layouts and the navbar.

- CSS is precompiled using `SCSS` for the structured coding.

- The website is hosted on [Netlify](https://www.netlify.com/).

- The project is a part of the learning from [Brad Traversy](https://github.com/bradtraversy)'s course on Udemy. The idea credit is his. I have understood the concepts and learned them by building this on my own with a bare minimum reference of source code (only when my efforts couldn't clear the roadblock). The way of execution is modified as per my viewpoint whenever is necessary.
