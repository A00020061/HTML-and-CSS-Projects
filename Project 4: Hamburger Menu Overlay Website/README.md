# Project 4: Hamburger-Menu-Overlay-Website

[Click here](https://gracious-spence-31e491.netlify.app/) for the live demo  of the website on [Netlify](https://www.netlify.com/).

> This is a boiler-plate webpage with a Hamburger Menu that is created only CSS (no JS). This can be extended to a full-fledged website by adding the corresponding sections inside the hamburger menu.

- The `hamburger menu` is created only with CSS, no JavaScript at all (yes, the CSS will be crazy!).

- An `image overlay` is created for the hero image using `::before and ::after pseudo-selectors`.

- `Google Fonts` is used for fonts.

- Icons are used from `Font Awesome`.

- `Flexbox` is used for creating layouts.

- CSS is precompiled using `SCSS` for the structured coding.

- The website is hosted both on [Netlify](https://www.netlify.com/) and [GitHub Pages](https://pages.github.com/).

- The project is a part of the learning from [Brad Traversy](https://github.com/bradtraversy)'s course on Udemy. The idea credit is his. I have understood the concepts and learned them by building this on my own with a bare minimum reference of source code (only when my efforts couldn't clear the roadblock). The way of execution is modified as per my viewpoint whenever is necessary.
