# Project 3: Presentation-Website

[Click here](https://stupefied-kowalevski-3623e5.netlify.app/) for the live demo  of the website on [Netlify](https://www.netlify.com/).

> This is a presentation website that is a parallel solution for a traditional PowerPoint presentation, especially for webinars and online meetings. 

- There is no scrolling as it is supposed to navigate through buttons which resembles a presentation.

- `CSS Animation`s like transition, transform, and translate properties are used to create animations.

- Icons are used from `Font Awesome`.

- `Flexbox` is used for creating layouts.

- A `smooth scrolling` effect is given using `JavaScript`.

- CSS is precompiled using `SCSS` for the structured coding.
- 
- The website is hosted both on [Netlify](https://www.netlify.com/) and [GitHub Pages](https://pages.github.com/).

- The project is a part of the learning from [Brad Traversy](https://github.com/bradtraversy)'s course on Udemy. The idea credit is his. I have understood the concepts and learned them by building this on my own with a bare minimum reference of source code (only when my efforts couldn't clear the roadblock). The way of execution is modified as per my viewpoint whenever is necessary.
